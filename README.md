wow ok that took longer than expected

see you might think that one could just simply set a timer, but the people behind this put in effort to make my life harder -- it decides to cancel all timers when the plug is toggled, and it only has room for one timer.

I'm putting in a lot of effort to be lazy

hopefully this saves a little time. next up, seeing if I can make a nice ui on alpine on my kindle to run this script (and also get my kindle to stay awake)
